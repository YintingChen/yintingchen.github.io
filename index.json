It is an entertaining film. Excellent video effects, and, especially, the surprising but wonderful combination of various versions of spider-men based on the Spider-Verse theory. I was not surprised to find that the audience could not help to shout \u0026ldquo;WOW\u0026rdquo; when different kinds of spider-men, say, Lego spider-man, real world spider-man, and so on, showed rightly on the big screen.\nThen we need a manager for the variety of universes. So here come the major questions, who should be the manager, or in the management group, and how to manage them.\nAs you can see, these are some really old-fashioned questions. This film, which lays out these questions before the audience, is the second one of this \u0026ldquo;Spider-Verse\u0026rdquo; series and it seems that the third one will answer these questions (and I hope it would do a good job).\nExcept the impression of the highly rated video effects, with what was I left after watching the film? Unfortunately, not so much. The questions it raised are rarely new. The relationships between the characters are not complicated. The hidden identity part was not dealt with very well so I just did not understand why Miles should hide his identity from his parents?\nBut the quality of this film\u0026rsquo;s video effects is incomparable and worth the money alone. I will support its third film and buy a Blue-Ray to enjoy every unique frame on my 4K TV.\n‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp I also finished \u0026ldquo;Ê∞¥ÊóèÈ§®„ÅÆÊÆ∫‰∫∫\u0026rdquo;, the second book of the famous Japanese detective story series by ÈùíÂ¥éÊúâÂêæ. This novel, in my opinion, is worse than the first one. The laying of the novel is strange because the favorite character, the detective who is of odd characteristics but unmatched detective ability, goes on to the stage too late.\nReaders like me keep asking themselves to be patient because the detective should show in the next section. But not. Okay, then in the second chapter. Unfortunately, there is still not.\nBesides, in the early chapters, the author introduces a number of new characters (more than eleven) and it is a headache job to remember them. Since you know remembering their names, genders, occupations are important for a smooth reading experience of a detective novel, this difficulty keeps haunting you until you bring out a piece of paper and write down the information.\nMy suggestion, why not give the characters some special names containing the information of their genders and occupations? In Japanese or Chinese, since characters are used, this is a rather easy task.\nBut after the detective appeared, such impatience disappeared, for I am really interested in the high school life the protagonist leads and the relationships between him and his friends and fellow students. Furthermore, as the story of the second book happens nearly half a year after that of the first, it provides more information about some characters, whose stories stop suddenly at the end of the first book.\nOverall, it is a good novel and I will read the third one of the series hopefully next week.\nüåÉ Feature imageÔºöSpot in \u0026ldquo;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2023-11-28","permalink":"/posts/00003/","section":"To make friends with time by my writing","summary":"I watched \u0026ldquo;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u0026rdquo; today.

So immediately the next comes to me is what will I post on my blog?\nI did not answer this question before this do-it-yourself game, because, in my opinion, in this day and age, everyone needs a place to tell his thoughts and keep them for reviewing and reflecting in the future. Another special reason for me is that I have already finished some English study materials and would like to further improve my English skills by writing.\nSo what would I post on my blog?\nFirst, I would like to post some articles about the books I read, movies I watch, and games I play everyday. If I do not record them, I will probably forget them in a near future, for they are some kinds of second hand experience and man tends to forget them easily.\nSecond, I plan to record the notes on some computer science and artificial intelligence courses here. To do this, I have already figured out some structures, say, the functions of code blocks and LaTeX and tested how to embed them into my articles.\nThird, I will sometimes share some interesting activities around me. For example, now we are in the Christmas market season in Berlin, so I may go to some very beautiful ones and shoot some pictures and post them here.\nThese three main types of stuff are what I want to post on my blog. Maybe there will be something new, who knows? But the most important thing is to post articles with a stable frequency. This kind of momentum of posting can help me to keep noticing something important or intriguing happened in my life, because before writing them down, you need to know them in mind.\nSimilarly, before noting down the key points from a course, you need to understand them well.\nI hope one year later when I review the passed year with the blog, I will be happy that I will have done so many things and proud of myself.\nüåÉ Feature imageÔºöA poster at BURGERARM, one of my favorite burger restaurant in Berlin.

Such a question came to me today when I was playing Persona 4 Golden and reading a detective story called \u0026ldquo;‰ΩìËÇ≤È§®„ÅÆÊÆ∫‰∫∫\u0026rdquo; by ÈùíÂ¥éÊúâÂêæ.\nI think I would do what I have already done. Though there were some regrets in my high school life, I do not think it will be worth going through it twice just to adjust those small stuff. And also, I do not think I have changed a lot from the high school self. Therefore, it would be highly likely that I go through all twice but make the same choices.\nSo when I play some high school games or read some detective novels based on high school life, I do not have such feelings of regret like some other people I found when I read the reviews of the games or books.\nBecause of this, luckily, I can purely enjoy the stories, acting and thinking as a character in those environments.\n‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp Persona 4 Golden is such a great game. It was originally released in 2008 on PlayStation 2. After that, as it is of such high quality, several more enhanced versions were made and released on many platforms like PSV, Switch, and Steam.\nIt also has a Japanese anime version, but I think this is a game worth spending 20 hours playing. The price is relatively very low, compared with the quality. So just buy the game and be careful to avoid spoilers contained in some reviews (DO NOT READ THEM). It is such a great game that you do not have to know anything further before buying it. Just buy and play it. Especially Steam is now holding an autumn sale.\nI have played P4G for 12 hours and saved the last (I think) partner out of a strange labyrinth. I read about the time people need to beat the game on a website called HowLongToBeat and it is about 20 hours. So I still have nearly another half ahead and I am going to slow down my pace, say, paying more attention to the monster cultivating and fusing parts.\nThe game offers you a chance to be friends with some very interesting people. I think man should just follow his heart to make choices and plan the time, avoiding checking some guides. The only problem I think for P4G is that it does not offer a girl main character so you can only act as a boy in the game.\n‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp‚òª\u0026nbsp The Japanese detective novel \u0026ldquo;‰ΩìËÇ≤È§®„ÅÆÊÆ∫‰∫∫\u0026rdquo; by ÈùíÂ¥éÊúâÂêæ is also entertaining. I spent about 4 hours reading its Chinese version today. It goes around a murder happened in a high school gymnasium. The detective in the story is a sophomore who has a clever mind but was a OTAKU, having secretly been living in a club room in the high school for more than one year.\nThe reason he promises to solve the case is to make money to buy manga and Blue-Ray anime. But in the end he makes real friends with some of his interesting fellow students.\nThe case is well prepared and the dialogs are intriguing. As this series contains 4 novels, I am looking forward to the other three!\nüåÉ Feature imageÔºö\u0026ldquo;Persona 4 Golden\u0026rdquo; wallpaper\n","date":"2023-11-26","permalink":"/posts/00001-i_do_not_want_to_go_through_it_again/","section":"To make friends with time by my writing","summary":"If I had a chance to lead a new life in my high school time, what would I do?
