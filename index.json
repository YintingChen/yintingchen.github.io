So immediately the next comes to me is what will I post on my blog?\nI did not answer this question before this do-it-yourself game, because, in my opinion, in this day and age, everyone needs a place to tell his thoughts and keep them for reviewing and reflecting in the future. Another special reason for me is that I have already finished some English study materials and would like to further improve my English skills by writing.\nSo what would I post on my blog?\nFirst, I would like to post some articles about the books I read, movies I watch, and games I play everyday. If I do not record them, I will probably forget them in a near future, for they are some kinds of second hand experience and man tends to forget them easily.\nSecond, I plan to record the notes on some computer science and artificial intelligence courses here. To do this, I have already figured out some structures, say, the functions of code blocks and LaTeX and tested how to embed them into my articles.\nThird, I will sometimes share some interesting activities around me. For example, now we are in the Christmas market season in Berlin, so I may go to some very beautiful ones and shoot some pictures and post them here.\nThese three main types of stuff are what I want to post on my blog. Maybe there will be something new, who knows? But the most important thing is to post articles with a stable frequency. This kind of momentum of posting can help me to keep noticing something important or intriguing happened in my life, because before writing them down, you need to know them in mind.\nSimilarly, before noting down the key points from a course, you need to understand them well.\nI hope one year later when I review the passed year with the blog, I will be happy that I will have done so many things and proud of myself.\n🌃 Feature image：A poster at BURGERARM, one of my favorite burger restaurant in Berlin.

Such a question came to me today when I was playing Persona 4 Golden and reading a detective story called \u0026ldquo;体育館の殺人\u0026rdquo; by 青崎有吾.\nI think I would do what I have already done. Though there were some regrets in my high school life, I do not think it will be worth going through it twice just to adjust those small stuff. And also, I do not think I have changed a lot from the high school self. Therefore, it would be highly likely that I go through all twice but make the same choices.\nSo when I play some high school games or read some detective novels based on high school life, I do not have such feelings of regret like some other people I found when I read the reviews of the games or books.\nBecause of this, luckily, I can purely enjoy the stories, acting and thinking as a character in those environments.\n☻\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp☻\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp☻\u0026nbsp Persona 4 Golden is such a great game. It was originally released in 2008 on PlayStation 2. After that, as it is of such high quality, several more enhanced versions were made and released on many platforms like PSV, Switch, and Steam.\nIt also has a Japanese anime version, but I think this is a game worth spending 20 hours playing. The price is relatively very low, compared with the quality. So just buy the game and be careful to avoid spoilers contained in some reviews (DO NOT READ THEM). It is such a great game that you do not have to know anything further before buying it. Just buy and play it. Especially Steam is now holding an autumn sale.\nI have played P4G for 12 hours and saved the last (I think) partner out of a strange labyrinth. I read about the time people need to beat the game on a website called HowLongToBeat and it is about 20 hours. So I still have nearly another half ahead and I am going to slow down my pace, say, paying more attention to the monster cultivating and fusing parts.\nThe game offers you a chance to be friends with some very interesting people. I think man should just follow his heart to make choices and plan the time, avoiding checking some guides. The only problem I think for P4G is that it does not offer a girl main character so you can only act as a boy in the game.\n☻\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp☻\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp☻\u0026nbsp The Japanese detective novel \u0026ldquo;体育館の殺人\u0026rdquo; by 青崎有吾 is also entertaining. I spent about 4 hours reading its Chinese version today. It goes around a murder happened in a high school gymnasium. The detective in the story is a sophomore who has a clever mind but was a OTAKU, having secretly been living in a club room in the high school for more than one year.\nThe reason he promises to solve the case is to make money to buy manga and Blue-Ray anime. But in the end he makes real friends with some of his interesting fellow students.\nThe case is well prepared and the dialogs are intriguing. As this series contains 4 novels, I am looking forward to the other three!\n🌃 Feature image：Persona 4 Golden wallpaper\n","date":"2023-11-26","permalink":"/posts/00001-i_do_not_want_to_go_through_it_again/","section":"To make friends with time by my writing","summary":"If I had a chance to lead a new life in my high school time, what would I do?
