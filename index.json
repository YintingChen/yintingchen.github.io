Such a question came to me today when I was playing Persona 4 Golden and reading a detective story called \u0026ldquo;体育館の殺人\u0026rdquo; by 青崎有吾.\nI think I would do what I have already done. Though there were some regrets in my high school life, I do not think it will be worth going through it twice just to adjust those small stuff. And also, I do not think I have changed a lot from the high school self. Therefore, it would be highly likely that I go through all twice but make the same choices.\nSo when I play some high school games or read some detective novels based on high school life, I do not have such feelings of regret like some other people I found when I read the reviews of the games or books.\nBecause of this, luckily, I can purely enjoy the stories, acting and thinking as a character in those environments.\nPersona 4 Golden is such a great game. It was released originally in 2008 on Playstation 2. After that, as it is of such high quality, several more enhanced versions were made and released on many platforms like PSV, Switch, and Steam.\nIt also has a Japanese anime version, but I think this is a game worth spending 20 hours playing it. The price is relatively very low, compared with the quality. So just buy the game and be careful to avoid spoilers contained in some reviews (DO NOT READ THEM). It is such a great game that you do not have to anything before buy it. Just buy and play it, especially now Steam is holding an autumn sale.\nI have played P4G for 12 hours and saved the last (I think) partner out of a strange labyrinth. I read about the time people need to beat the game on a website called HowLongToBeat and it is about 20 hours. So I still have nearly another half ahead and I am going to slow down my pace, say, paying more attention to the monster cultivating and fusing parts.\nThe game offers you a chance to be friends with some very interesting people. I think man should just follow his heart to make the choices and plan the time and avoid checking some guides. The only problem I think for P4G is that it does not offer a girl main character so you can only act as a boy in the game.\nThe Japanese detective novel \u0026ldquo;体育館の殺人\u0026rdquo; by 青崎有吾 is also entertaining. I spent about 4 hours reading its Chinese version today. It goes around a murder happened in a high school gymnasium. The detective in the story is a sophomore who has a clever mind but was a OTAKU, having secretly been living in a club room in the high school for more than one year.\nThe reason he promises to solve the case is to make money to buy manga and Blue-Ray anime. But in the end he makes real friends with some of his interesting fellow students.\nThe case is well prepared and the dialogs are intriguing. As this series contains 4 novels, I am looking forward to the other three!\n🌃 Feature image：Persona 4 Golden wallpaper\n","date":"2023-11-26","permalink":"/posts/00001-i_do_not_want_to_go_through_it_again/","section":"To make friends with time by my writing","summary":"If I had a chance to lead a new life in my high school time, what would I do?
