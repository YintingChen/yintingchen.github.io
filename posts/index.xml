      <description>Today is the first day in December and I went outside to visit the Hamburger Bahnhof Gallery and the WeihnachtsZauber Gendarmenmarkt Christmas Market.
The &amp;ldquo;Devouring Lovers&amp;rdquo; exhibition by Eva Fàbregas is now going on in Hamburger Bahnhof Gallery and here are some photos I shot there today.</description>

      <description>The essential idea of dynamic programming is to save the result for future use.
For example, if I have already know 1+2+3 equals 6 and saved the result at a place, then when I have to calculate 1+2+3+4, I just have to calculate 6+4 instead of going from scratch.</description>

      <description>I watched &amp;ldquo;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&amp;rdquo; today. It is an entertaining film. Excellent video effects, and, especially, the surprising but wonderful combination of various versions of spider-men based on the Spider-Verse theory.</description>

      <description>If I had a chance to lead a new life in my high school time, what would I do? Such a question came to me today when I was playing Persona 4 Golden and reading a detective story called &amp;ldquo;体育館の殺人&amp;rdquo; by 青崎有吾.</description>
